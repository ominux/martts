\section{Case Study} \label{sec:case}
In this section we will conduct one case study to demonstrate how the device-architecture co-optimization methodology can help design STT-RAM cache with different optimization directions. We will replace the L1 SRAM instruction cache and data cache by there different STT-RAM caches: latency-optimized STT-RAM, energy-optimized STT-RAM, or EDP-optimized STT-RAM. We are the first to explore design space of STT-RAM utilizing PMTJ as L1 cache replacement and compare the results with The optimization techniques are the same with those used in Section~\ref{subsec:co-opt}.

We normalize instruction per cycle (IPC), energy and EDP to SRAM-based cache. Note that energy here includes read dynamic energy, write dynamic energy and leakage energy. Figure~\ref{fig:ipc} shows the simulations results in terms of normalized IPC when using the three different STT-RAM caches. Figure~\ref{fig:energy} presents the energy saving percentage of replacing SRAM by these STT-RAM caches. Figure~\ref{fig:edp} illustrates the EDP value of STT-RAM caches for different benchmarks. We can see that the latency-optimized STT-RAM has almost 50\% better IPC than SRAM, while it has negative energy saving compared to SRAM. Energy-optimized STT-RAM has approximately 60\% average energy saving compared to SRAM while maintaining only 8\% degraded IPC of SRAM. EDP-optimized STT-RAM has about 20\% better IPC than SRAM and also nearly 40\% energy saving compared to SRAM. Figure~\ref{fig:ratio} shows the variation in read/write statistics for different benchmarks.
